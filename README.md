# 3dsegmentation [under construction]

Code for a segmentation model for anatomical data from the fly brain.


## Problem

The following animation shows a 3D volume of the fly optic lobe recorded over 24h during development in the larval stage. 
The task is to segment all visual columns in the red channel and characterize the growth of the single neuron in the green channel over time.
